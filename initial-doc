hello there.
make thyself and island which no flood can overflow.
so long love for the women, if a single bit is there,
you will have no peace.
find peace within
make thyself and island

oneday everyone will have to die
so quiet your desire and quarrel today
the body will be left despised like a useless log

i will think of death more and more
i will recognize this life as a gift
so i will not waste a single moment
if anyone hurts me, let them do it
i will endure it silently.
there is no me.
